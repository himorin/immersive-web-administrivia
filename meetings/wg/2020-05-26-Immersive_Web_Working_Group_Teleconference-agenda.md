* [webxr#1036 "Ensure an immersive device" cannot be run in parallel](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1036) [requested by Manishearth](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1036#issuecomment-629598102)
> I see four rough options:
>
> 1. Remove the `xrCompatible` flag from `getContext()`, notify users that they should use `makeXRCompatible()` instead, which is asynchronous. This will break existing content unless we stop erroring when the [`XR compatible`](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xr-compatible)  flag is not set. 
> 2. Same as (1), but we also stop erroring when the [`XR compatible`](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xr-compatible) flag is not set. This will not break existing content because browsers do not do anything meaningful with this flag _yet_, but existing content may continue to obliviously use this flag and eventually break when browsers start handling this. Furthermore, the "context isn't xr compatible" error is _useful_On the other hand, it gets rid of the `partial dictionary` and the weird `getContext()`-patching we're doing which isn't very kosher anyway.
> 3. Allow `xrCompatible` to introduce slow sync behavior in `getContext()`, perhaps with a deprecation warning. This is not great; slow sync APIs are bad
> 4. Have `.getContext({xrCompatible: true})` behave like `.getContext()` + `makeXRCompatible()`, where we create a context for the device if we know what it is, otherwise create a normal context, and then trigger context loss/restore if it turns out that we were supposed to create a different context. This is slightly weird and applications may be forced to handle the context loss event in select cases on select devices. In a perfect world they would be doing this anyway, however I suspect a lot of content isn't. This puts us in a similar bucket as 2., where this is not a breaking change, but when browsers implement this we will start having problems, and that too only with specific devices.
>
> Our current spec makes the `getContext()` API block, which is really bad and we should discuss ways to avoid that. None of the choices are particularly good
